            <p>Web development perfectly compliments my creativity and problem-solving abilities. This along with the detail-oriented nature of coding draws me in daily and plays through my mind even after I've stepped away. When I'm not coding, you can find me at the climbing gym or better yet, up one of the canyons around SLC, chalk covering my hands and drawing in my sketchbook. </p>
